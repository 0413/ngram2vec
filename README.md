# ngram2vec
The toolkit implements the ngram2vec model proposed in emnlp 2017

In this work, we introduce ngrams into recent word representation methods inspired by traditional language modeling problem. Significant improvements are witnessed in some settings when ngrams are considered. For example, PPMI achieves 85+ accuracy on Google analogy questions (semantic group).
